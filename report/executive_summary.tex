This design report contains the necessary information to review the PC-Based Modular 
Diagnostics Tool project and consider it for implementation. Major sections of the
report include an introduction to the project, an overall project description,
total cost details, an implementation schedule and detailed technical descriptions of each
subsystem. Included in the subsystem descriptions are a description of each subsystem
and its relation to other subsystems, a summary of design options considered, a list 
of materials and components utilized, a summary of costs incurred and engineering drawings.

The expected time to implement the design is \_\_\_ INSERT IMPLEMENTATION TIME HERE \_\_\_.
This estimate includes the total time needed for fabrication and assembly of parts.

The total cost for implementation of the PC-Based Modular Diagnostics Tool is
