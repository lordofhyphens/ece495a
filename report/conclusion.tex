\section[Conclusions \& Recommendations]{Conclusions \& Recommendations}
A fully-functional prototype was not able to be attained, so the design
performance is currently unknown. Further work needs to go into refining,
building and testing the project design.

Though final testing of the prototype is still required, it is notable that each sub-system is
in the testing stages. The implementation schedule in Figure \ref{fig:implement sched} will
certainly produce the additional data required to continue expanding system functionality.
It is recommended that further power-saving research be conducted to fully leverage the 
stand-by capabilities of the MCUs and WT32. The battery system can be modularized aside from 
the WT32 so as to implement a standalone charger for a multi-cell Li-Poly battery to enhance
battery life. The software can be scaled to optimize user environment and provide additional control
options for further modular development. While RoHS compliant components were not used in all
sub-systems, it is recommened that this be a priority for production purposes.
