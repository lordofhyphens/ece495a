\section[Introduction]{Introduction}
This project seeks to design a low-cost, modular diagnostic tool platform, 
suitable for hobbyist use and field work at low required sample rates 
(typically under 50K-samples/second). It also serves as a flexible and easily 
modifiable base for any type of data acqusition features wireless connectivity. 
 Wireless connectivity is what differentiates this design from similar tools. This application allows the user to collect
data with many potential aqcuisition modules while simulatenously logging the
information on a nearby laptop computer. The software allows for a
straightforward interpretation of the collected data as well as a control interface.
Modules currently being explored are a multimeter and digital logic analyzer. 
It is the intent of this design report to quantify the design so that current
modules are further tested and improved while also providing the basis for
additional module development.
