\section[Implementation]{Implementation Schedule}
The implementation schedule for the Modular Wireless Diagnostics Tool is shown
in Figure \ref{fig:implement sched}. The schedule begins on January 2, 2010 and 
is organized in weekly increments. Because the system requires further testing,
the schedule includes three weeks of prototype testing and further design refinement.
Following this period, a two-week lead-time allowed for order and shipment of parts, 
and one week alotted for part assembly and final system testing. The total estimated
implementation time is 6 weeks.
