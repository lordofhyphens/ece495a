\section*{Introduction}
This report documents three approaches to designing and simulating a biquad low-pass filter. Structural Verilog is the design medium for the filter and Modelsim was used to produce raw output data while Matlab is used to plot and interpret the results. The output waveforms should indicate the attenuation of high frequencies and noise filtration.
