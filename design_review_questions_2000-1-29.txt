Questions to consider asking during the design review, referring to where
in the design you're referring to).
*) Adapting logic voltage levels (Ref: External-attached logic analyzer)
*) Discrete ADC or integrated ADC (Ref: O-scope, other similar probes)
*) Suggestions as to whether it would be more efficient as to whether to place the I/O on a main bus or to sequester it through a microcontroller's interface (such as UART). 
*) All in all, just see if what we plan to do will work.
