Assessment report:
	Tools used:
		* git, a Source Code Repository (used to coordinate collaboration of 
		       all electronic documents).
		* Email, for non-immediate communication.
		* Skype, for a couple teleconferences.
		* LaTeX, for formatting the design report.
		* OpenOffice.org Calc, for spreadsheet calculations

Recommendations: 
	* If the team plans to produce electronic documents, place them under 
revision control using a tool such as git or Subversion. All team members should
spend some time familiarizing themselves with the use. These steps will allow 
a team to efficently make changes to documents, as well as allow the manager to
keep track of who is changing what. Stick with plain text files as much as 
possible.
	* Take special note of any packaging purchased integrated circuits are 
available in. This will help alleviate headaches later.
