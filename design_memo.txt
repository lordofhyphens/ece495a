Assessment report:
	Tools used:
		* git, a Source Code Repository (used to coordinate collaboration of 
		       all electronic documents).
		* Email, for non-immediate communication.
		* Skype, for a couple teleconferences.
		* LaTeX, for formatting the design report.
		* OpenOffice.org Calc, for spreadsheet calculations
		* CADSoft EAGLE was used for schematic generation.
		* Atmel AVR Studio, ATMega MCU simulation.
		* avr-gcc, C compiler for Atmel microcontrollers.

	Management process changes:
		* Meetings were kept short and to the point, often becoming quick
		  check-ins with the project manager as to what needed to be done. 
		* The RASI chart was there to appease the instructors, as were the
		  divisions into subsystems. The system was integrated enough to 
		  make "strict" subsystems problematic. The logical subsystems were
		  organized by interfaces to each other.
		* Parts were ordered for the prototype on an as-needed basis.
		* The manager sought to use a more agile method, which meant remaining
		  open to change.

Recommendations: 
	* If the team plans to produce electronic documents, place them under 
      revision control using a tool such as git or Subversion. All team members
      should spend some time familiarizing themselves with the use. These steps
      will allow a team to efficently make changes to documents, as well as 
      allow the manager to keep track of who is changing what. Stick with 
      plain text files as much as possible - they mesh better with SCM systems.
	* Take special note of any packaging purchased integrated circuits are 
      available in. This will help alleviate headaches later. 
	* Changes happen. Don't plan so far ahead that a single change breaks
      everything.
