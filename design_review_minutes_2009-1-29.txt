Minutes
Begin 3:25pm
Joe: Describes on how the project is divided into 2 parts (shows block diagram).

Weston: What is sample rate?

Joe: 1-4 Msamples.

Osborn: Will you need a MCU?

Joe: Resistor adjustments by use of Analog Mux.

Wes: Talk about signal acquisition. 

Advisors: Make sure to clamp so that the device does not blow up.

Hwnag: Switch polarity, switch 5V to 2.5V, connect to single ground, use big capacitor at most right OP AMP.

Osborn: Bluetooth is serial, will you have enough bandwidth?

Joe: I think so; I will need to run the numbers.

Douglas: The design that the acquisition design is based off of has a digital to analog converter and I am not sure why.

Osborn: DAC may be needed to do self corrections.

Purcell: Why do you not use the 741 OP AMP?

Wes: I just went with the first OP AMP I found in Eagle.

Advisors: Compare the OP AMPS.

Purcell: Why do you not use WIFI?

Joe: Because we would have to make the drivers on the Windows side.
Purcell: Make sure to order as soon as possible.

Harackiwikz: Why have you not ordered yet?

Joe: I am waiting for a more concrete design.

Purcell: We have had teams in the past order components and those not come until after they graduated.

Osborn: Bluetooth DIP may be able to make things simpler.

Osborn: You guys have a lot of interesting work ahead of you.

Harackiwikz: Will hardwire be primary or backup connection?

Joe: We want to do both hardwire and wireless, preferring wireless.

Tragoudas: I will be happy to help.
